## Code Wars Katas

Code Wars started out fun, because it was different from what I was normally doing, and I could do the easy ones quickly.  Eventually, I lost interest when they got into optimizing algorithms that work, to work faster.  These quickly become language specific and are of limited reusability.

The sudoku puzzle solvers got spun off into a seperate project, which is now in another repo, so that code may seem a bit unfinished and the sky scraper puzzles have a good deal of shared code, but I still felt like these all belonged in one spot.
